Start by asking questions to clarify the problem:

What type of resources are we pooling? (e.g., threads, database connections, objects)
How will the resources be used and by whom? (e.g., multiple users or processes)
Are there specific limits on the number of resources?
What happens when all resources are in use? Do we block new requests, queue them, or fail them?
Example clarification for a connection pooling system:

The system manages a fixed number of database connections.
Multiple clients can request a connection to the database.
The pool should provide a connection if one is available; if not, the client may wait or fail.
2. Identify Key Components
Break the problem into core components of the system:

Pool Manager: Manages the lifecycle of resources (creation, allocation, and release).
Resource/Connection Object: Represents the resource (e.g., a database connection).
Client/Consumer: Requests and releases resources from the pool.
Queue/Blocking Mechanism: Manages requests when no resources are available.
3. Define Key Operations
List the core operations for the system:

Create Resource: Initializes a new resource when the pool is below the limit.
Acquire Resource: Provides a resource to a client, waits if none are available.
Release Resource: Returns a resource to the pool after usage.
Destroy Resource: Cleans up the resources when no longer needed (e.g., closing a connection).
4. Basic Workflow
Explain how the system works:

A client requests a resource from the pool.
The pool checks if an available resource exists.
If yes, the client is given the resource.
If no, and the pool limit is reached, the client is either blocked (if blocking is allowed) or an exception is thrown.
Once the client is done with the resource, it releases it back to the pool.
The pool manager keeps track of used and available resources.
5. Class Design (UML or Pseudocode)
Design the system using simple classes and their interactions:

Classes:
ResourcePool

Attributes:
maxPoolSize: Maximum number of resources allowed in the pool.
availableResources: List of resources available for use.
inUseResources: Set of resources currently being used.
Methods:
getResource(): To acquire a resource.
releaseResource(resource): To release the resource back to the pool.
Resource (Connection)

Attributes:
id: Unique identifier for the resource.
Methods:
connect(): Establishes a connection.
disconnect(): Closes the connection.
Client

Methods:
requestResource(pool): Requests a resource from the pool.
useResource(resource): Uses the resource.
returnResource(pool, resource): Returns the resource back to the pool
